 Nepal Climate Analysis Documentation
 Overview
This documentation provides detailed information about the Nepal Climate Change Impact Assessment and Prediction System. The system analyzes climate data from 2000-2023 to identify trends and patterns related to climate change in Nepal, and provides predictions for future climate conditions.

 Project Components
 1. Data Source
The project uses the nepal_climate_data_2000_2023.csv file which contains daily climate records with the following columns:

- YEAR , MO , DY : Date components
- T2M : Average temperature (°C)
- T2M_MAX : Maximum temperature (°C)
- T2M_MIN : Minimum temperature (°C)
- PRECTOTCORR : Precipitation (mm)
- latitude , longitude : Geographic coordinates
 2. Jupyter Notebook (climateAnalysis.ipynb)
The Jupyter notebook contains the data analysis pipeline and model training:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing : Loads the CSV data, handles missing values, and creates derived features
- Exploratory Data Analysis : Visualizes temperature and precipitation trends
- Extreme Weather Event Analysis : Identifies and analyzes extreme heat, cold, and heavy rain days
- Machine Learning Model Development : Trains models to predict temperature and precipitation
- Future Climate Prediction : Generates predictions for 2024-2028
 3. Streamlit Application (app.py)
The interactive web application provides visualizations and predictions through several pages:

6. Future Predictions :
   
   - Interactive prediction tool for specific dates and locations
   - Future climate trends visualization (2024-2028)
 Technical Implementation
 Data Processing
The application performs several data processing steps:



Visualization Techniques
The application uses several visualization libraries:

- Plotly : For interactive charts (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn : For static visualizations
- Streamlit : For interactive widgets and layout
Troubleshooting
 Common Issues
1. KeyError: 'YEAR'
   
   This error occurs if the CSV file has leading spaces in column names. The fix is implemented in the app with:
   
2. Model files not found
   
   Ensure you've run the Jupyter notebook completely to generate the model files.
3. Invalid date errors in prediction
   
   The app uses validation to prevent invalid date combinations (like February 31).
## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:

1. Integration with real-time climate data sources
2. Expanded geographic coverage beyond Nepal
3. Additional machine learning models for other climate variables
4. Enhanced visualization options and comparative analysis tools
